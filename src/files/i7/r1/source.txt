"Omnia Autem Probate" by Jeff Nyman

The story headline is "An Interactive Exploratory Test".
The story genre is "Fantasy".
The story description is "This is the Omnia Autem Probate -- loosely, 'Test all the Things' -- version of a popular game called 'Trinity', written by Brian Moriarty in 1986, published by Infocom.

The goal of this project is to use interactive fiction as a means to promote test exploration and experimentation. This project was created as a playground for discussing topics about exploratory testing with testers and developers, to better develop intuitions regarding the complexity of testing a problem space.

Being such, this 'game' is not a faithful reproduction of 'Trinity' but, rather, uses that game as the basis for providing a series of graduated, and hopefully fun, challenges. This project is being done in connection with a series of posts on Exploring Testing with Interactive Fiction."
